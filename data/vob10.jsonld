The surface lies along the Clywedog, a tributary of the Ithon; and is a charming, fertile bottom, environed and overhung by picturesque wooded hills. A Cistertian Abbey was founded here, in 1143, by Cadwathelan ap Madoc; and destroyed, in 1401, by Owen Glendower. The property belonged, in the 17th century, to Sir Wm. Fowler, concerning whom it was said,-</p><blockquote><p>There is neither a park nor a deer<br/>To be seen in all Radnorshire,<br/>Nor a man with five hundred a year<br/>Save Fowler of Abbey-Cwm-Hir.</p></blockquote><p>The Abbey church was 255 feet long and 73 feet wide but only a few fragments of it remain. The mansion of F. Philips, Esq., partly built with the stones of the church in 1816, stands adjacent. A Roman road goes up the vale past the Abbey, toward the valley of the Marteg. The living of Abbey-Cwm-Hir is a vicarage in the diocese of St David's. Value, &pound;61. Patron, G. H. Philips, Esq. The church was rebuilt in 1867, and is in the Continental first pointed style.",

It has a post office under Bangor, a station on the Chester and Holyhead railway, and a comfortable inn. It is a charming place, and is much frequented by tourists. The views all round, and in the neighborhood, over sea and land, are rich and varied; and some of them are panora mic and extensive. The Lavan sands extend in front, dry for 4 miles at low water; and may be crossed on foot, with a guide, to the ferry of Beaumaris. The glen of the Gwyngregyn, narrow and romantic, strikes about 2 miles inland flanked on one side by a well-wooded lofty hill,-on the other side by the stupendous rock of Maes y Gaer; and is blocked at the head by the dark, vast, concave precipice of the hill Bera, over which falls the famous cataract Rhayadr Mawr. The cataract is fringed with ash trees; and first breaks on the cliffs into three or four parts, then makes a sheer leap of more than 60 feet. An artificial conical mound, near the village, was the site of a Palace of the Welsh princes, where Llewelyn the Great received the summons to surrender his rights to Edward I. of England. A field, not far off, called Cae Gwilym Dhu, \"Black William's Field,\" was the scene of the summary execution of the Norman baron, William de Braose, whom Llewelyn ap Iorwerth had taken prisoner, and whom he suspected of an intrigue with his princess. A well-known Welsh distich, alluding to this event, records the following question and answer:-</p><blockquote><p>'Lovely princess,' said Llewelyn,<br/>`What will yon give to see your Gwilym?'<br/>`Wales and England, and Llewelyn,<br/>I'd give them all to see my Gwilym.'</p></blockquote><p>The parish of Aber comprises 8,833 acres; of which 1,515 are water.

Pennant.-The church is ancient, with a square tower, in moderate condition. There are chapels for Calvinistic Methodists and Wesleyans.

The town stands on the South Wales railway, in the western vicinity of Taibach, 5&frac12; miles SSE of Neath, and 32&frac14; WNW of Cardiff. It is a borough, municipal and par liamentary, and a sub-port under the port of Swansea. It consists of an old part, a little inland, which is Aberavon-proper, and a new part, on the shore, which em braces the harbour, and is called Port-Talbot. It has a post office&Dagger; of its own name under Taibach, and a station of the name of Port-Talbot on the railway. It was recently a small village, but has grown rapidly in connexion with neighboring mines and the export of their produce. Its harbour was highly improved in 1838 by a new cut for the river, and gives floating accommodation with considerable depth. Numerous coasting vessels frequent it; and steamers come from Bristol. Fairs are held on the second Friday in May, and on 24 June, 1 July, 14 Aug., 7 Oct., and 1 Nov. The municipal borough lies wholly in Aberavon parish, and is governed by a portreeve and two aldermen. The parliamentary borough includes also part of Margam parish, and part of the hamlet of Upper Michaelstone; and is linked in the franchise with Swansea. Pop. in 1851, 6,567; in 1861, 7,754. Houses, 1,423.&#151;The parish comprises 1,943 acres of land and 655 of water.-Real property, &pound;5,073. Pop. in 1831, 573; in 1861, 2,916. Houses, 531. The property is much sub-divided. The living is a vicarage, united to Baglan, in the diocese of Llandaff. Value, &pound;154.* Patron, G. Llewellyn, Esq. The church is an edifice in the middle pointed style; consists of nave, chancel, and south aisle, with a tower; and was built in 1860, at a cost of &pound;2,120. There are chapels for Independents, Baptists, Calvinistic Methodists, Primitive Methodists, Bible Christians, and Roman Catholics. Some remains exist on Aberavon Myndyd hill, of the castle of Caradoc ab Jestyn, which was destroyed in 1150. Some interesting localities are in the neighborhood. See Taibach, Margam, Cwm-Avon, and Baglan.",

The village stands near the Chester and Holyhead railway, 7 miles WNW of St. Asaph, and 34&frac14; W of Chester. It has a station, with telegraph, on the railway, a head post office,&Dagger; and two hotels; and it is a seat of petty sessions, a seaport, and a watering-place. It consists chiefly of one wide, irregular street, along the highway, about &frac12; a mile from the shore. A weekly market is held on Saturday; and fairs are held on 2 April, on the day before Holy Thursday, on 18 June, 20 Aug., 9 Oct., and 6 Dec. The beach is excellent bathing-ground; and the surrounding scenery, of coast and mountain, is magnificent. Limestone is extensively shipped; lead, copper, and manganese occur in the neighbourhood; and some fine studies for the geologist, in varieties of rock, are near. Castell-Cawr, on a high rock about a mile inland from the church, is one of the most perfect Roman camps in Wales; and Gorddyn-Mawr, on Coppa'r Wylfa, or \"the mount of the watch-tower,\" a mile further W, is a large, strong, British hill-fort. Gwrych Castle, the seat of L. H. B. Hesketh, Esq., under a high hill on the coast, about a mile W of the village, is a modern castel lated edifice, with a frontage of 480 yards, a tower 93 feet high, and 17 turrets; and the grounds around it command delightful views, but they are not open to the public. Cave hill, in the vicinity of Gwrych, is a cal careous rock, pierced with several curious caverns; and one of these, called Cefn Ogo, has an entrance-arch 30 feet high, makes a brilliant display of stalactites and stalagmites, goes very far into the bowels of the hill, but cannot be safely explored beyond 40 yards, and was the place where Richard II. lay concealed, when betrayed to Bolingbroke by Percy. Brynffanigle, within Abergele, was the residence of Marchudd ab Cynon, Prince of North Wales; and an old mansion, now demolished, was the home of some of the early life of the poet, Mrs. Hemans. The parish includes the townships of Abergele, Bodorryn, Botegwel, Brynffanigle, Dolganned, Fowyn-Isaf, Garth-Gogo, Gwrych, Hendre-Gyda-Isaf, Hendre-Gyda-Uchaf, Nant, Sirior, and Twyn-Isaf and Uchaf. Acres, together with the parish of St. George, 1,998 of land, and 2,055 of water. Real property, &pound;9,386. Pop., 3,308. Houses, 727. The property is not much divided. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of St. Asaph. Value, &pound;400. Patron, the Bishop of St. Asaph. The church is a neat good structure, of the time of Henry VIII There are Independent, Bap tist, Calvinistic-Methodist, and Wesleyan chapels, and charities &pound;13.-The subdistrict comprises five parishes.
